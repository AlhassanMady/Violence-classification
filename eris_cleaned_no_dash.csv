All the common people were in debt to the rich. For they either tilled their lands for them, paying them a sixth of the increase (whence they were called Hectemoiroi and Thetes), or else they pledged their persons for debts and could be seized by their creditors, some becoming slaves at home, and others being sold into foreign countries. 
[3] Many, too, were forced to sell their own children (for there was no law against it), or go into exile, because of the cruelty of the money-lenders. But the most and sturdiest of them began to band together and exhort one another not to submit to their wrongs, but to choose a trusty man as their leader, set free the condemned debtors, divide the land anew, and make an entire change in the form of government.","Ï„ÏŒÏ„Îµ Î´á½² Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Ï„á¿¶Î½ Ï€ÎµÎ½Î®Ï„Ï‰Î½ Ï€Ïá½¸Ï‚ Ï„Î¿á½ºÏ‚ Ï€Î»Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¯Î¿Ï…Ï‚ á¼€Î½Ï‰Î¼Î±Î»Î¯Î±Ï‚ á½¥ÏƒÏ€ÎµÏ á¼€ÎºÎ¼á½´Î½ Î»Î±Î²Î¿ÏÏƒÎ·Ï‚ Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î¬Ï€Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î½ á¼Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ†Î±Î»á¿¶Ï‚ á¼¡ Ï€ÏŒÎ»Î¹Ï‚ Î´Î¹Î­ÎºÎµÎ¹Ï„Î¿, ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¼ÏŒÎ½Ï‰Ï‚ á¼‚Î½ á¼Î´ÏŒÎºÎµÎ¹ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÏƒÏ„á¿†Î½Î±Î¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ï€Î±ÏÏƒÎ±ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹ Ï„Î±ÏÎ±Ï„Ï„Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Î· Ï„Ï…ÏÎ±Î½Î½Î¯Î´Î¿Ï‚ Î³ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Î·Ï‚. á¼…Ï€Î±Ï‚ Î¼á½²Î½ Î³á½°Ï á½ Î´á¿†Î¼Î¿Ï‚ á¼¦Î½ á½‘Ï€ÏŒÏ‡ÏÎµÏ‰Ï‚ Ï„á¿¶Î½ Ï€Î»Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¯Ï‰Î½. á¼¢ Î³á½°Ï á¼Î³ÎµÏŽÏÎ³Î¿Ï…Î½ á¼ÎºÎµÎ¯Î½Î¿Î¹Ï‚ á¼•ÎºÏ„Î± Ï„á¿¶Î½ Î³Î¹Î½Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Ï‰Î½ Ï„ÎµÎ»Î¿á¿¦Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚, á¼‘ÎºÏ„Î·Î¼ÏŒÏÎ¹Î¿Î¹ Ï€ÏÎ¿ÏƒÎ±Î³Î¿ÏÎµÏ…ÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¸á¿†Ï„ÎµÏ‚, á¼¢ Ï‡ÏÎ­Î± Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Î¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ á¼Ï€á½¶ Ï„Î¿á¿–Ï‚ ÏƒÏŽÎ¼Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î½ á¼€Î³ÏŽÎ³Î¹Î¼Î¿Î¹ Ï„Î¿á¿–Ï‚ Î´Î±Î½ÎµÎ¯Î¶Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½ á¼¦ÏƒÎ±Î½, Î¿á¼± Î¼á½²Î½ Î±á½Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î´Î¿Ï…Î»ÎµÏÎ¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚, Î¿á¼± Î´á¾½ á¼Ï€á½¶ Ï„á½´Î½ Î¾Î­Î½Î·Î½ Ï€Î¹Ï€ÏÎ±ÏƒÎºÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹.

620,Pausanias stabs Philip II.,interpersonal,Classical Greece,regicide,emotional,stabbing,dagger,"[1] Pausanias, nevertheless, nursed his wrath implacably, and yearned to avenge himself, not only on the one who had done him wrong, but also on the one who failed to avenge him. In this design he was encouraged especially by the sophist Hermocrates. He was his pupil, and when he asked in the course of his instruction how one might become most famous, the sophist replied that it would be by killing the one who had accomplished most, for just as long as he was remembered, so long his slayer would be remembered also. [2] Pausanias connected this saying with his private resentment, and admitting no delay in his plans because of his grievance he determined to act under cover of the festival in the following manner. [3] He posted horses at the gates of the city and came to the entrance of the theatre carrying a Celtic dagger under his cloak. When Philip directed his attending friends to precede him into the theatre, while the guards kept their distance, he saw that the king was left alone, rushed at him, pierced him through his ribs, and stretched him out dead; then ran for the gates and the horses which he had prepared for his flight. [4] Immediately one group of the bodyguards hurried to the body of the king while the rest poured out in pursuit of the assassin; among these last were Leonnatus and Perdiccas and Attalus. Having a good start, Pausanias would have mounted his horse before they could catch him had he not caught his boot in a vine and fallen. As he was scrambling to his feet, Perdiccas and the rest came up with him and killed him with their javelins.","[1] á½ Î´á½² Î Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ±Î½Î¯Î±Ï‚ á¼€Î¼ÎµÏ„Î¬Î¸ÎµÏ„Î¿Î½ Ï†Ï…Î»Î¬Ï„Ï„Ï‰Î½ Ï„á½´Î½ á½€ÏÎ³á½´Î½ á¼”ÏƒÏ€ÎµÏ…Î´Îµ Î¼á½´ Î¼ÏŒÎ½Î¿Î½ Ï€Î±Ïá½° Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Ï€ÏÎ¬Î¾Î±Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚ Î»Î±Î²Îµá¿–Î½ Ï„Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏÎ¯Î±Î½, á¼€Î»Î»á½° ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ï€Î±Ïá½° Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î¼á½´ Ï„Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏÎ¿á¿¦Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚ Î±á½Ï„á¿·.

At first he did not take her seriously because Alexander did not heed her complaints against him, but later, as their enmity kept growing and the king showed an anxiety to gratify his mother in everything out of piety, Antipater gave many indications of his disaffection. This was bad enough, but the murder of Parmenion and Philotas struck terror into Antipater as into all of Alexander's Friends, so by the hand of his own son, who was the king's wine-pourer, he administered poison to the king. [2] After Alexander's death, Antipater held the supreme authority in Europe and then his son Casander took over the kingdom, so that many historians did not dare write about the drug.

This Arsinoe, fearing for her children, lest on the death of Lysimachus they should fall into the hands of Agathocles, is said for this reason to have plotted against Agathocles. Historians have already related how Arsinoe fell in love with Agathocles, and being unsuccessful they say that she plotted against his life. They say also that Lysimachus discovered later his wife's machinations, but was by this time powerless, having lost all his friends.[4] Since Lysimachus, then, overlooked Arsinoe's murder of Agathocles, Lysandra fled to Seleucus, taking with her her children and her brothers, who were taking refuge with Ptolemy and finally adopted this course. They were accompanied on their flight to Seleucus by Alexander who was the son of Lysimachus by an Odrysian woman. So they going up to Babylon entreated Seleucus to make war on Lysimachus.

When the deed was discovered, and Alexander fled in fear of the citizens, Ptolemy returned and for the second time assumed control of Egypt. He made war against the Thebans, who had revolted, reduced them two years after the revolt, and treated them so cruelly that they were left not even a memorial of their former prosperity, which had so grown that they surpassed in wealth the richest of the Greeks, the sanctuary of Delphi and the Orchomenians. Shortly after this Ptolemy met with his appointed fate, and the Athenians, who had been benefited by him in many ways which I need not stop to relate, set up a bronze likeness of him and of Berenice, his only legitimate child.","ÎšÎ»ÎµÎ¿Ï€Î¬Ï„ÏÎ±Î½ Î´á½² Ï€ÎµÏÎ¹á¿†Î»Î¸ÎµÎ½ á¼¡ Î´Î¯ÎºÎ· Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Î Ï„Î¿Î»ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¯Î¿Ï… Ï†Ï…Î³á¿†Ï‚ á¼€Ï€Î¿Î¸Î±Î½Î¿á¿¦ÏƒÎ±Î½ á½‘Ï€á½¸ á¼ˆÎ»ÎµÎ¾Î¬Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Ï…, á½ƒÎ½ Î±á½Ï„á½´ Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»ÎµÏÎµÎ¹Î½ á¼”Ï€ÏÎ±Î¾ÎµÎ½ Î‘á¼°Î³Ï…Ï€Ï„Î¯Ï‰Î½.

As soon as the army approached the walls, they set fire to the mixture and poured it out, showering it all together like rain on the besiegers. The pitch mixed with the other ingredients (see above), when poured out, penetrated through the exposed parts of the body and spread all over the person. Men tore off their burning breast-plates and other armour because the metal was getting red-hot, and the leather and wooden parts were burning and shrinking. And so one had the spectacle of soldiers who had actually stripped themselves, and of weapons that had been abandoned, looking like spoils of warâ€”all this achieved not by military prowess, but by scientific skill.

The Romans, ignorant of what they had done, rushed in after them, expecting to sack the whole place without striking a blow; thus they got inside the circle of fire, and, with their minds intent upon the enemy, saw nothing of it until they were surrounded by it on all sides. Then they found themselves in the direst peril, being pelted by the men from above and injured by the fire from without. They could neither remain where they were safely nor force their way out anywhere without danger. For if they stood out of range of the missiles, they were scorched by the fire, or, if they leaped back from the flames, they were destroyed by the missiles; and some who got caught in a tight place perished from both causes at once, being wounded on one side and burned on the other. The majority of those who had rushed into the town met this fate; but some few escaped by casting corpses into the flames and making a passage for themselves by using the bodies as a bridge.","á¼Î½Ï„Îµá¿¦Î¸ÎµÎ½ Î´á½² á¼Ï€á½¶ á¿¬Î±Î¯Ï„Î¹Î½Î¿Î½ á¼Î»Î¸ÏŒÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ Î¿á½Ï‡ á½Î¼Î¿Î¯Ï‰Ï‚ á¼€Ï€Î®Î»Î»Î±Î¾Î±Î½.

The next day they advanced in a little better order, and even reached open country, though they did not get off without loss. Upon setting out from there they plunged into the woods again, where they defended themselves against their assailants, but suffered their heaviest losses while doing so. For since they had to form their lines in a narrow space, in order that the cavalry and infantry together might run down the enemy, they collided frequently with one another and with the trees. They were still advancing when the fourth day dawned, and again a heavy downpour and violent wind assailed them, preventing them from going forward and even from standing securely, and moreover depriving them of the use of their weapons. For they could not handle their bows or their javelins with any success, nor, for that matter, their shields, which were thoroughly soaked.

And because the pitch-black clouds of smoke made it impossible to see, the legions were roused to the fight by the clarion and in battle array advanced at rapid pace. Then, as their ardour for fighting gradually increased and they had come to hand-to-hand conflict, on a sudden all the siege-engines were destroyed by the spreading flames, except the greater ram; this, after the ropes which had been thrown from the walls and entangled it had been broken, the valiant efforts of some brave men barely rescued in a half-burned condition.","Cumque pauciores utrubique fierent bellatores, et Persae truderentur ad ultima ni potior ratio succurrisset, impensiore opera procursus temptabatur ex castris, et eruptione subita multitudinis facta, inter armatos qui portabant ignes amplioribus ordinatis, iaciebantur corbes in materias ferreae, plenae flammarum, et sarmenta aliaque ad ignes concipiendos aptissima.

When these preparations had been sufficiently made, just before dawn our men were drawn up in three divisions and tried an assault upon the walls, the cones of their helmets nodding in threatening wise and many carrying scaling-ladders. And now, while arms clashed and trumpets brayed, both sides fought with equal ardour and courage. And as the Romans extended their forces more widely and saw that the Persians were in hiding through fear of the engines placed upon the mounds, they attacked a tower with the ram; and in addition to mattocks, pickaxes, and crowbars the scaling- ladders also drew near, while missiles flew thick and fast from both sides.","Utque facile defensuri moenia pellerentur, in ipsis aggerum summitatibus binae sunt locatae ballistae, quarum metu ne prospicere quidem posse hostium quisquam crederetur.

And while the Romans now pressed hard on those who gave way, and now met those who ventured to charge, the men who carried the fire-pans, stooping low and creeping along, pushed live coals into the joints of one of the mounds, which was built of the boughs of various kinds of trees, of rushes, and of bundles of cane.

2246,Pausanias stabs Philip II.,interpersonal,Classical Greece,regicide,emotional,stabbing,dagger,"[1] Pausanias, nevertheless, nursed his wrath implacably, and yearned to avenge himself, not only on the one who had done him wrong, but also on the one who failed to avenge him. In this design he was encouraged especially by the sophist Hermocrates. He was his pupil, and when he asked in the course of his instruction how one might become most famous, the sophist replied that it would be by killing the one who had accomplished most, for just as long as he was remembered, so long his slayer would be remembered also. [2] Pausanias connected this saying with his private resentment, and admitting no delay in his plans because of his grievance he determined to act under cover of the festival in the following manner. [3] He posted horses at the gates of the city and came to the entrance of the theatre carrying a Celtic dagger under his cloak. When Philip directed his attending friends to precede him into the theatre, while the guards kept their distance, he saw that the king was left alone, rushed at him, pierced him through his ribs, and stretched him out dead; then ran for the gates and the horses which he had prepared for his flight. [4] Immediately one group of the bodyguards hurried to the body of the king while the rest poured out in pursuit of the assassin; among these last were Leonnatus and Perdiccas and Attalus. Having a good start, Pausanias would have mounted his horse before they could catch him had he not caught his boot in a vine and fallen. As he was scrambling to his feet, Perdiccas and the rest came up with him and killed him with their javelins.","[1] á½ Î´á½² Î Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ±Î½Î¯Î±Ï‚ á¼€Î¼ÎµÏ„Î¬Î¸ÎµÏ„Î¿Î½ Ï†Ï…Î»Î¬Ï„Ï„Ï‰Î½ Ï„á½´Î½ á½€ÏÎ³á½´Î½ á¼”ÏƒÏ€ÎµÏ…Î´Îµ Î¼á½´ Î¼ÏŒÎ½Î¿Î½ Ï€Î±Ïá½° Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Ï€ÏÎ¬Î¾Î±Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚ Î»Î±Î²Îµá¿–Î½ Ï„Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏÎ¯Î±Î½, á¼€Î»Î»á½° ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ï€Î±Ïá½° Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î¼á½´ Ï„Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏÎ¿á¿¦Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚ Î±á½Ï„á¿·.

At first he did not take her seriously because Alexander did not heed her complaints against him, but later, as their enmity kept growing and the king showed an anxiety to gratify his mother in everything out of piety, Antipater gave many indications of his disaffection. This was bad enough, but the murder of Parmenion and Philotas struck terror into Antipater as into all of Alexander's Friends, so by the hand of his own son, who was the king's wine-pourer, he administered poison to the king. [2] After Alexander's death, Antipater held the supreme authority in Europe and then his son Casander took over the kingdom, so that many historians did not dare write about the drug. Casander, however, is plainly disclosed by his own actions as a bitter enemy to Alexander's policies. He murdered Olympias and threw out her body without burial, and with great enthusiasm restored Thebes, which had been destroyed by Alexander.","Ï†Î±Ïƒá½¶ Î³á½°Ï á¼ˆÎ½Ï„Î¯Ï€Î±Ï„ÏÎ¿Î½ á¼Ï€á½¶ Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Î•á½ÏÏŽÏ€Î·Ï‚ ÏƒÏ„ÏÎ±Ï„Î·Î³á½¸Î½ á½‘Ï€á¾½ Î±á½Ï„Î¿á¿¦ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï†Î¸Î­Î½Ï„Î± Î´Î¹ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ‡Î¸á¿†Î½Î±Î¹ Ï€Ïá½¸Ï‚ á½ˆÎ»Ï…Î¼Ï€Î¹Î¬Î´Î± Ï„á½´Î½ Î¼Î·Ï„Î­ÏÎ± Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»Î­Ï‰Ï‚ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ï„á½¸ Î¼á½²Î½ Ï€Ïá¿¶Ï„Î¿Î½ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ï†ÏÎ¿Î½Îµá¿–Î½ Î±á½Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Î´Î¹á½° Ï„á½¸ Î¼á½´ Ï€ÏÎ¿ÏƒÎ´Î­Ï‡ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹ Ï„á½¸Î½ á¼ˆÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Î½ Ï„á½°Ï‚ ÎºÎ±Ï„á¾½ Î±á½Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î´Î¹Î±Î²Î¿Î»Î¬Ï‚, á½•ÏƒÏ„ÎµÏÎ¿Î½ Î´á¾½ Î±á¼°Îµá½¶ Ï„á¿†Ï‚ á¼”Ï‡Î¸ÏÎ±Ï‚ Î±á½Î¾Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Î·Ï‚, Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»Î­Ï‰Ï‚ Î´Î¹á½° Ï„á½¸ Ï€Ïá½¸Ï‚ Ï„á½¸ Î¸Îµá¿–Î¿Î½ Îµá½ÏƒÎµÎ²á½²Ï‚ Ï€Î¬Î½Ï„Î± Î²Î¿Ï…Î»Î¿Î¼Î­Î½Î¿Ï… Ï„á¿‡ Î¼Î·Ï„Ïá½¶ Ï‡Î±ÏÎ¯Î¶ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹, Ï€Î¿Î»Î»á½°Ï‚ á¼Î¼Ï†Î¬ÏƒÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Î´Î¹Î´ÏŒÎ½Î±Î¹ Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Ï€Ïá½¸Ï‚ Î±á½Ï„á½¸Î½ á¼€Î»Î»Î¿Ï„ÏÎ¹ÏŒÏ„Î·Ï„Î¿Ï‚: Ï€Ïá½¸Ï‚ Î´á½² Ï„Î¿ÏÏ„Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Ï„á¿†Ï‚ Î Î±ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¯Ï‰Î½Î¿Ï‚ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¦Î¹Î»ÏŽÏ„Î¿Ï… ÏƒÏ†Î±Î³á¿†Ï‚ Ï†ÏÎ¯ÎºÎ·Î½ á¼Î¼Ï€Î¿Î¹Î¿ÏÏƒÎ·Ï‚ Ï„Î¿á¿–Ï‚ Ï†Î¯Î»Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Î´Î¹á½° Ï„Î¿á¿¦ á¼°Î´Î¯Î¿Ï… Ï…á¼±Î¿á¿¦ Ï„ÎµÏ„Î±Î³Î¼Î­Î½Î¿Ï… Ï€ÎµÏá½¶ Ï„á½¸Î½ ÎºÏÎ±Î¸Î¿Î½ Î´Î¿á¿¦Î½Î±Î¹ Ï€Î¹Îµá¿–Î½ Î¸Î±Î½Î¬ÏƒÎ¹Î¼Î¿Î½ Ï†Î¬ÏÎ¼Î±ÎºÎ¿Î½ Ï„á¿· Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»Îµá¿–.

This Arsinoe, fearing for her children, lest on the death of Lysimachus they should fall into the hands of Agathocles, is said for this reason to have plotted against Agathocles. Historians have already related how Arsinoe fell in love with Agathocles, and being unsuccessful they say that she plotted against his life. They say also that Lysimachus discovered later his wife's machinations, but was by this time powerless, having lost all his friends.[4] Since Lysimachus, then, overlooked Arsinoe's murder of Agathocles, Lysandra fled to Seleucus, taking with her her children and her brothers, who were taking refuge with Ptolemy and finally adopted this course. They were accompanied on their flight to Seleucus by Alexander who was the son of Lysimachus by an Odrysian woman. So they going up to Babylon entreated Seleucus to make war on Lysimachus. And at the same time Philetaerus, to whom the property of Lysimachus had been entrusted, aggrieved at the death of Agathocles and suspicious of the treatment he would receive at the hands of Arsinoe, seized Pergamus on the Caicus, and sending a herald offered both the property and himself to Seleucus.","[3] Îµá¼°ÏŽÎ¸Î±ÏƒÎ¹ Î´á½² á¼€Î½Î¸ÏÏŽÏ€Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Ï†ÏÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹ Î´Î¹á¾½ á¼”ÏÏ‰Ï„Î± Ï€Î¿Î»Î»Î±á½¶ ÏƒÏ…Î¼Ï†Î¿ÏÎ±Î¯.

The pitch mixed with the other ingredients (see above), when poured out, penetrated through the exposed parts of the body and spread all over the person. Men tore off their burning breast-plates and other armour because the metal was getting red-hot, and the leather and wooden parts were burning and shrinking. And so one had the spectacle of soldiers who had actually stripped themselves, and of weapons that had been abandoned, looking like spoils of warâ€”all this achieved not by military prowess, but by scientific skill.

For the enemy, overwhelmed by their numbers and unable to withstand them, set fire of their own accord to the encircling wall and to the houses adjoining it, contriving, however, to keep it so far as possible from blazing up at once and to make it go unnoticed for some time; after doing this they retired to the citadel. The Romans, ignorant of what they had done, rushed in after them, expecting to sack the whole place without striking a blow; thus they got inside the circle of fire, and, with their minds intent upon the enemy, saw nothing of it until they were surrounded by it on all sides. Then they found themselves in the direst peril, being pelted by the men from above and injured by the fire from without. They could neither remain where they were safely nor force their way out anywhere without danger. For if they stood out of range of the missiles, they were scorched by the fire, or, if they leaped back from the flames, they were destroyed by the missiles; and some who got caught in a tight place perished from both causes at once, being wounded on one side and burned on the other. The majority of those who had rushed into the town met this fate; but some few escaped by casting corpses into the flames and making a passage for themselves by using the bodies as a bridge.","á¼Î½Ï„Îµá¿¦Î¸ÎµÎ½ Î´á½² á¼Ï€á½¶ á¿¬Î±Î¯Ï„Î¹Î½Î¿Î½ á¼Î»Î¸ÏŒÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ Î¿á½Ï‡ á½Î¼Î¿Î¯Ï‰Ï‚ á¼€Ï€Î®Î»Î»Î±Î¾Î±Î½.

The next day they advanced in a little better order, and even reached open country, though they did not get off without loss. Upon setting out from there they plunged into the woods again, where they defended themselves against their assailants, but suffered their heaviest losses while doing so. For since they had to form their lines in a narrow space, in order that the cavalry and infantry together might run down the enemy, they collided frequently with one another and with the trees. They were still advancing when the fourth day dawned, and again a heavy downpour and violent wind assailed them, preventing them from going forward and even from standing securely, and moreover depriving them of the use of their weapons. For they could not handle their bows or their javelins with any success, nor, for that matter, their shields, which were thoroughly soaked.

And because the pitch-black clouds of smoke made it impossible to see, the legions were roused to the fight by the clarion and in battle array advanced at rapid pace. Then, as their ardour for fighting gradually increased and they had come to hand-to-hand conflict, on a sudden all the siege-engines were destroyed by the spreading flames, except the greater ram; this, after the ropes which had been thrown from the walls and entangled it had been broken, the valiant efforts of some brave men barely rescued in a half-burned condition.","Cumque pauciores utrubique fierent bellatores, et Persae truderentur ad ultima ni potior ratio succurrisset, impensiore opera procursus temptabatur ex castris, et eruptione subita multitudinis facta, inter armatos qui portabant ignes amplioribus ordinatis, iaciebantur corbes in materias ferreae, plenae flammarum, et sarmenta aliaque ad ignes concipiendos aptissima.

When these preparations had been sufficiently made, just before dawn our men were drawn up in three divisions and tried an assault upon the walls, the cones of their helmets nodding in threatening wise and many carrying scaling-ladders. And now, while arms clashed and trumpets brayed, both sides fought with equal ardour and courage. And as the Romans extended their forces more widely and saw that the Persians were in hiding through fear of the engines placed upon the mounds, they attacked a tower with the ram; and in addition to mattocks, pickaxes, and crowbars the scaling- ladders also drew near, while missiles flew thick and fast from both sides.","Utque facile defensuri moenia pellerentur, in ipsis aggerum summitatibus binae sunt locatae ballistae, quarum metu ne prospicere quidem posse hostium quisquam crederetur.

And while the Romans now pressed hard on those who gave way, and now met those who ventured to charge, the men who carried the fire-pans, stooping low and creeping along, pushed live coals into the joints of one of the mounds, which was built of the boughs of various kinds of trees, of rushes, and of bundles of cane.
