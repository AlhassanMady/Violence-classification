# Enhancing Knowledge Extraction from Violent Ancient Historical Texts through Fine-Tuned Large Language Models and Historical Databases

This repository contains the code, datasets, and scripts associated with my master's thesis: **"Enhancing Knowledge Extraction from Violent Ancient Historical Texts through Fine-Tuned Large Language Models and Historical Databases"**. The research focuses on utilizing fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa to automate the classification of violent and non-violent passages in historical texts.

## üìù Thesis Overview

The thesis explores two main experiments:

1. **Binary Classification**: We used fine-tuned versions of BERT and RoBERTa to classify texts as either violent or non-violent. The models were trained on a custom dataset combining entries from the ERIS database and full texts retrieved from the Perseus Digital Library.

2. **Multi-Class Classification**: We expanded the analysis to categorize violent events across four dimensions:
   - **Level of Violence**: interpersonal, intrapersonal, intersocial, intrasocial
   - **Context**: political, military, social, etc.
   - **Motive**: strategic, emotional, religious, etc.
   - **Long-Term Consequences**: death, conquest, plunder, etc.

## üìä Datasets
The dataset used for this research is based on the ERIS system for violent texts and additional non-violent examples extracted from the Perseus Digital Library. The dataset was further cleaned and preprocessed to ensure a balanced classification dataset.
